Program that draws a Bezier Curve between up to 33 points. Can also draw every lower degree curve.
http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/ <- an excellent, in-depth explanation of bezier curves
Bezier.py
 - click on the screen to create control points
 - after 2 control points are drawn, every subsequent point will allow for the drawing of a bezier curve
 - for every subsequent control point, a button will appear in the top left, allowing you to draw nth degree curves
